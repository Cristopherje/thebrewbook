        <h2>The Perfect Espresso Shot</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>18-20 grams of finely ground coffee beans</li>
          <li>Hot water (filtered)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Grind your coffee beans to a very fine texture, similar to table
            salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the grounds into the portafilter and tamp (press) them down
            evenly with about 30 lbs of pressure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lock the portafilter into the machine and start brewing immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            Extract for about 25 to 30 seconds. You should end up with about 1
            ounce of liquid with a golden crema on top. Serve immediately.
          </li>
        </ol>
