    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Espresso is the foundation of almost every coffee drink. It is a concentrated form of coffee, served in small,
        strong shots. A perfect shot should have a rich flavor and be topped with a golden-brown foam called "crema".
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>18-20 grams of finely ground coffee beans</li>
        <li>Hot water (filtered)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind your coffee beans to a very fine texture, similar to table salt.</li>
        <li>Place the grounds into the portafilter and tamp (press) them down evenly with about 30 lbs of pressure.</li>
        <li>Lock the portafilter into the machine and start brewing immediately.</li>
        <li>Extract for about 25 to 30 seconds. You should end up with about 1 ounce of liquid with a golden crema on
            top. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
