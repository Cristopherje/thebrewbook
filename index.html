          <h2>The Classic Cappuccino</h2>
          <p>
            The cappuccino is an Italian classic that is all about texture. It
            consists of equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and thick milk foam.
            It is perfect for those who want a strong coffee taste with a
            creamy, velvety finish.

          <h2>The Perfect Espresso Shot</h2>
          <p>
            Espresso is the foundation of almost every coffee drink. It is a
            concentrated form of coffee, served in small, strong shots. A
            perfect shot should have a rich flavor and be topped with a
            golden-brown foam called "crema".

          <h2>The Creamy Mocha</h2>
          <p>
            A mocha is the perfect marriage between coffee and hot chocolate. It
            combines the intensity of espresso with sweet chocolate syrup and
            steamed milk, often topped with whipped cream. It is a dessert-like
            treat for coffee lovers.
